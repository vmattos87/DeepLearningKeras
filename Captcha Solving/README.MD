<h1>OCR Model for Captcha Solving</h1>
This code demonstrates a simple OCR model built with Keras Functional API. 

The Keras Functional API can create models that are more flexible than the tf.keras.Sequential API, for it can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, multiple inputs or outputs. In this project we'll use the class `tf.data`, it enables us to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces.

The dataset contains 1040 captcha files as png images.
