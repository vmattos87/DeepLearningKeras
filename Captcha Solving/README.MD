#OCR Model for Captcha Solving
This code demonstrates a simple OCR model built with Keras Functional API. 

The Keras Functional API can create models that are more flexible than the tf.keras.Sequential API, for it can handle models with non-linear topology, shared layers, multiple inputs or outputs.
